**🎤 Taylor Swift Data Dashboard – Personal Project (Taylor’s Version)**

**📝 Introduction**

  This is my first personal data analytics project where I combined music, storytelling, and analytics into one interactive dashboard – powered by Power BI and Python. As a Swiftie and a data enthusiast, I chose Taylor Swift because her musical journey is rich in both emotion and evolution – perfect for data-driven storytelling.

**🎯 Objective**

  To explore Taylor Swift’s discography using real-world data and answer powerful questions around her popularity, musical style, and emotional tone using data visualizations, Python, and Power BI.

**🔍 Dataset & Cleaning**

Source: Publicly available dataset of 357 Taylor Swift songs

Tools: Python (pandas, matplotlib)

Steps:

1) Removed duplicates and filtered for official tracks

2) Grouped original albums vs Taylor’s Version (TV)

3) Extracted and engineered key audio features: tempo, valence, energy, loudness, duration

4) Saved cleaned data for visualizations in Power BI

**📊 Dashboard Design: 3-Page Era-Themed Layout**


**📍 Overview Page**  

1) Includes bio, debut year, album and song count, Grammy wins

2) Sets the tone with color and font inspired by Taylor’s eras

3) High-level view of song characteristics across years

4) Includes danceability, valence, energy, acousticness

5) Highlights top songs and albums visually

**🎯 Core Analytical Questions**

**🪩 Page 1 – Musicality**

1) Are high-energy songs long and wild — or short and striking?

   Taylor’s high-energy hits are short and punchy, while low-energy ones are longer and mellow.

2) Did Taylor start acoustic and go electric?

   Yes! Her debut is twice as acoustic as 1989.

3) Are fast songs always happy, or does Taylor sneak in sadness?
 
   Nope — fast tempo doesn't guarantee happiness; valence is independent.

**💿 Page 2 – Popularity & Emotion**

1) Has Taylor’s music gained momentum over time?

   Popularity rises sharply after 2014, peaking in the Lover era.

2) Did Taylor’s Versions outperform the originals?

   Taylor’s Versions often match or surpass the originals years later.

3) Are sad songs secretly fan favorites?

   Yes — low valence (sad) songs dominate popularity.

**🧪 Tools & Tech**

1) Python: for cleaning, filtering, and feature engineering

2) Power BI: for layout, interactivity, charting

**📌 Summary**

  This project taught me how to combine emotion, visual storytelling, and data analytics to form powerful narratives. With custom hypotheses and handcrafted visuals, I’ve explored music through the lens of data – proving how analytical thinking can live even in the most creative spaces.
